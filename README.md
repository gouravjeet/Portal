First, there are a few essentials for installing node
    Needed for Node:
    $sudo apt-get install node
    $sudo apt-get install npm
    Needed for Grunt
    $sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    Needed for Bower
    $npm install -g bower
Cloning into the code
    $git clone https://github.com/gouravjeet/Portal.git
    cd SGIS-2.0/
    grunt serve 
Now, you need to install the project dependencies

Needed for Bower Packages:
    $bower install --save
Needed for Grunt Packages:
    $sudo npm install --save
    The --save option instructs NPM to include the package inside of the dependencies section of your package.json automatically, thus saving you an additional step.
